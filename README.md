# Spot Search

### Note - Use case of this application is very niche but its fun to use

#### This application integrates Spotify and Twilio APIs and make adding songs into your Spotify Playlist simpler

So let me explain what does this application actually do and why do we need this??
Consider a case when you are chatting with your friend on whatsapp and he/she suggested you a song. Not you want this song in your playlist but at the same time you are **toooooooooooo lazy to open spotify app(maybe 100 more 'o' when your phone is laggy like mine)** --> **click on search button** --> **search for the complex song name** --> **and few more steps to add it into your well curated playlist**  

Now what if you can instantly switch to other chat(you can call it your spot servent) and type that same name your friend typed and you get top 3 search results directly from Spotify within this whatsapp chat and you just need to type "yes" to add this song in your playlist. Yes this is possible with this **Rails App**

### Requirements to just try the app and suggest me your favorite songs via this app-
* 1) You just need to subscribe to following Twilio channel for this -
